Insertion Sort Project

First Part => Stages

[22, 27, 16, 2, 18, 6] => n process
[2, 27, 16, 22, 18, 6] => (n - 1) process
[2, 6, 16, 22, 18, 27] => (n - 2) process
[2, 6, 16, 18, 22, 27] end...
Second Part => Big O Notation

n + (n -1) + (n - 2) + ... + 1 = [n * (n + 1)] / 2
(n^2 + n) / 2 => dominant function = n^2
=> O(n^2)
Third Part => Time Complexity

Average Case: If i looking for the middle number.
Worst Case: If i looking for the last number.
Best Case: If i looking for the first number.
Fourth Part => Which case does the number 18 fall into?

Average Case, because in the middle.
